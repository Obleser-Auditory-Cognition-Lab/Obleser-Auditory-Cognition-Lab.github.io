Hi, so you found the password-protected part of the website - well done hacker! 😃

If you want to keep people from accessing certain documents on the website, put them into this folder. 

⚠️ Important! ⚠️
Please keep in mind that while the website may be password-protected, the source code on Github is publicly visible. 
If you want to share secrets with the other members of the lab, embed a Google Doc in the HTML file and limit the access 
there instead of putting everything directly into your code.
